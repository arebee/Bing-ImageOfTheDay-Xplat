# Bing image of the day - Cross Platform

This is a fork of <https://github.com/timothymctim/Bing-wallpapers>
mainly to add MacOS support. Thanks for the project [Tim!](https://github.com/timothymctim)

## Added Features

1. Supports MacOS and Linux execution using PowerShell on those
platforms. While I haven't tested on Linux, it has worked on one
user's machine. :-)
1. Can use an alternate (unofficial) source of image metadata by
specifying `-UseAlternateSource` on the command line. The official Bing
endpoint supports the last 15 days, the unofficial endpoint has over 1000 entries,
if it is working/available.
1. A script (`update-imagemetadata.ps1`) that uses [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/)
to update the image metadata in the source files to reflect the
metadata in the feed. The downloaded images don't include them, strangely.
    1. ExifTool is available for MacOS and Windows, but not Linux.
    1. This script uses the information in both the Bing API and the JSON endpoint source. The Bing API has more detailed descriptions.
1. Renamed script and paramaters to be more idiomatic PowerShell.
1. Now supports -WhatIf.
1. Updated to include a Powershell Module manifest.

### Added Parameters

### Notes

1. Support for the `auto` resolution detection on MacOS relies on the
information returned from `system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType` and
with multiple displays this may provide a lower resolution than
you may desire. Set `$VerbsosePreference = 'Continue'` or use the `-Verbose` switch to see
diagnostic messages such as the screen resolution detected if you
don't provide a preference. This seemed to occur in a dual monitor
situation where the retina display in the laptop and is mirroring
an external display. You may want to manually specify the resolution
manually instead.

## Something Similar

<https://github.com/dabeastnet/PixelPoSH> generates geometric desktop
images using an SVG generator. Thanks for the tip

## Bing image of the day

This Windows PowerShell script fetches the Bing "Image of the Day".
Using this script you can set the Bing image of the day as your
wallpaper.

The script uses the API backing the [Microsoft Bing](https://www.bing.com/)
page to download the images.
With a few extra steps, the script allows you to set your wallpaper to
the Bing image of the day, just like using [Bing
desktop](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/buckh/archive/2013/01/02/bing-desktop-set-your-background-to-the-bing-image-of-the-day.aspx)
(which might be unavailable in your region or you do not want to
install).

## Script options

The script supports several options which allows you to customize the
behavior.

* `-Locale <string>` Get the Bing image of the day for the specified
  [region](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd251064.aspx).
  If auto is used, the API endpoint will select the locale used.

  **Possible values** `'auto'`, `'ar-XA'`, `'bg-BG'`, `'cs-CZ'`,
  `'da-DK'`, `'de-AT'`, `'de-CH'`, `'de-DE'`, `'el-GR'`, `'en-AU'`,
  `'en-CA'`, `'en-GB'`, `'en-ID'`, `'en-IE'`, `'en-IN'`, `'en-MY'`,
  `'en-NZ'`, `'en-PH'`, `'en-SG'`, `'en-US'`, `'en-XA'`, `'en-ZA'`,
  `'es-AR'`, `'es-CL'`, `'es-ES'`, `'es-MX'`, `'es-US'`, `'es-XL'`,
  `'et-EE'`, `'fi-FI'`, `'fr-BE'`, `'fr-CA'`, `'fr-CH'`, `'fr-FR'`,
  `'he-IL'`, `'hr-HR'`, `'hu-HU'`, `'it-IT'`, `'ja-JP'`, `'ko-KR'`,
  `'lt-LT'`, `'lv-LV'`, `'nb-NO'`, `'nl-BE'`, `'nl-NL'`, `'pl-PL'`,
  `'pt-BR'`, `'pt-PT'`, `'ro-RO'`, `'ru-RU'`, `'sk-SK'`, `'sl-SL'`,
  `'sv-SE'`, `'th-TH'`, `'tr-TR'`, `'uk-UA'`, `'zh-CN'`, `'zh-HK'`,
  `'zh-TW'`

  **Default value** `'auto'`

  **Remarks** By using the value `'auto'`, Bing will attempt to
  determine an applicable locale.

  Currently, only the values `'de-DE'`, `'en-AU'`, `'en-CA'`, `'en-GB'`,
  `'en-IN'`, `'en-US'`, `'fr-CA'`, `'fr-FR'`, `'ja-JP'`, and `'zh-CN'`
  will have their own localized version. Other values will be considered
  as the “Rest of the World” by Bing.

* `-Count <Int32>` Will fetch the most recent `-Count` images. When used
  with `-Delete` it will keep only this number of images in the folder,
  *any other file matching* `????-??-??.jpg` *will be* **removed**!

  **Default value** `3`

  **Remarks** Setting this option to `0` will keep all images and will
  not remove any file.

* `-Delete [<SwitchParameter>]` Removes images not in the most recent download.

  **Default Value** Not used

  **Remarks** If specified then all images in folder are sorted and 
  only the most recent $count are kept and all others are deleted.

* `-Resolution` Determines which image resolution will be downloaded.
  If set to `'auto'` the script will try to determine which resolution
  is more appropriate based on your primary screen resolution.

  **Possible values** `'auto'`, `'800x600'`, `'1024x768'`, `'1280x720'`,
  `'1280x768'`, `'1366x768'`, `'1920x1080'`, `'1920x1200'`, `'720x1280'`,
  `'768x1024'`, `'768x1280'`, `'768x1366'`, `'1080x1920'`, `'UHD'`

  **Default value** `'auto'`

* `-FromAlternativeSource [<SwitchParameter>]` Use an unofficial source for wallpaper information.

  **Default Value** Not used.

  **Remarks** The unofficial endpoint contains a history that is longer than the offical endpoint (which is capped at 15 most recent images).

* `-Path` Destination folder to download the images to.

  **Default value**
  `"$([Environment]::GetFolderPath("MyPictures"))\Wallpapers"`
  (the subfolder `Wallpapers` inside your default Pictures folder)

  **Remarks** The folder will automatically be created if it doesn’t
  exist already. If unspecified the system images folder will be used
  with a Wallpaper subfolder.

* `-WhatIf [<SwitchParameter>]` Execute script without making changes to
  the local system.

## Set as your wallpaper

With a few additional steps you’re able to automatically download the
latest images and set them as your wallpaper.

### Automatically run the script

First, make sure that you can actually run PowerShell scripts.
You might have to set the execution policy to unrestricted by running
`Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` in a PowerShell window executed with
administrator rights.
Additionally, you might need to unblock the file since you downloaded
the file from an untrusted source on the Internet.
You can do this by running `Unblock-File <path to the script>` as
administrator.
Note that the script itself doesn’t need to be run as administrator!

You can configure to run the script periodically using “Task Scheduler.”
Open Task Scheduler and click `Action` ⇨ `Create Task…`.
Enter a name and description that you like.
Next, add a trigger to run the task once a day.
Finally, add the script as an action.
Run the program `powershell` with the arguments `-WindowStyle Hidden
-file "<path to the script>" <optional script arguments>`.

### Changing your background settings

Go to `Settings` ⇨ `Personalization` ⇨ `Background` and select
`Slideshow` as the `Background` type.
Hit the `Browse` button to select the folder you automatically download
the images to (the default is the folder `Wallpapers` inside your
Pictures folder).
